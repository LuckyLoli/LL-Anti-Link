Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 05, 2025

1. Information We Collect
The LL Anti Link bot may collect the following data to function:
- Server IDs and channel IDs for logging purposes.
- User IDs and role IDs for verification and admin management.
- Message content to detect links (processed locally and not stored).

2. How We Use Your Data
Data is used solely to provide the Bot's functionality (e.g., link detection, punishment actions). We do not sell or share your data with third parties.

3. Data Storage
Collected data is stored temporarily in memory or in a local JSON file on the host server and is not uploaded to external servers unless explicitly configured by the server admin.

4. Your Rights
You can request the removal of your data by contacting the server admin or the Bot developer. Removing the Bot from your server will also stop data collection.

5. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no online service is 100% secure. You use the Bot at your own risk.

6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated. Changes will be reflected here, and continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance.
