    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: May 05, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The LL Anti Link bot may collect the following data to function:
    - Server IDs and channel IDs for logging purposes.
    - User IDs and role IDs for verification and admin management.
    - Message content to detect links (processed locally and not stored).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Data is used solely to provide the Bot's functionality (e.g., link detection, punishment actions). We do not sell or share your data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Collected data is stored temporarily in memory or in a local JSON file on the host server and is not uploaded to external servers unless explicitly configured by the server admin.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can request the removal of your data by contacting the server admin or the Bot developer. Removing the Bot from your server will also stop data collection.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no online service is 100% secure. You use the Bot at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated. Changes will be reflected here, and continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>For privacy concerns, contact us at [Your Email or Support Link, e.g., privacy@yourdomain.com].</p>
